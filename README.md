coinmarketcap for bitcoin forks

Bitcoin-Forks is an open source and free to use project for collecting and aggregating forks of bitcoin. 
It's purpose is to get an overview of the potential money bitcoin holders have due to their forks and how to get/sell them.

It contains the following sub projects (just in a directory)

## Data Crawler

The crawler is responsible for collecting the needed data from coinmarketcap and other websites. As there are some statistics over a period of time the data will be stored as long as possible.

## Data Aggregator

The aggregator works on the ouput of the crawler. It consumes the needed information for the final website and saves them in a readable json format

## Website Builder

The website builder creates optimized .html and .json files for a fast user experience afterwards on the website - speed is the name of the game ;-)

## Website

The final website. It contains only static files (html, js, ...). No backend is needed


## General

You are very welcome to help and join our awesome project :-)
